            This 1973 song from the band Pink Floyd is a band favorite. We are big fans of this album and this song specifically. We stripped down a lot of the flare you normally see in a Pink Floyd album to create a more rustic instrumental sound that focuses on the memorable riffs and complex vocals of the songs.

            This 2019 song might as well be the definition of an indie hit. The simplicity of the instrumentals and vocals make this a really fun song to play with crowds. We encourage all our audience members to sing along and with this song most people will know the words. The breaks between each verse allow for fun pauses that build anticipation.

            As much as we love performing other songs, we do not want to be a cover band. We mess around with riffs and instrumental songs often, and have lots of poems that could become lyrics. The songwriting process is ongoing and the more music we play the more we want to write.
