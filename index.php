    <h2>As It Stands</h2>
    <p>As it stands our band is a jam band that focuses on covers, originals, and improvisation. With our covers we try to find songs with unique riffs, funky bass lines or interesting vocals. Each member of the band enjoys challenges and working on new and difficult songs. We are a small band and are open to auditioning new members. If you play guitar or bass, we’d be happy to listen to you play. We are currently looking for a drummer, although wind and string instruments are also welcome. We care less about making a consistent type of music and more about making music that is consistently good. Additionally, if you don’t play an instrument but have songwriting or singing experience, we’d love to get in touch with you.
